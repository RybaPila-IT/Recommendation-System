## Story time

<p align="justify">
In this project we play the role of an analyst working in the company "eSzoppping" - an online store with electronics and computer games.
Working on this position is not easy - the task we get in the form of enigmatic description and it is up to us to specify the details so that they can be implemented.  This, of course, requires understanding the problem, analyzing data, sometimes negotiating with the boss. Apart from analyzing the issue and training the models, we have to prepare them for production implementation - assuming that in the future there will be new versions, with which we will experiment.
